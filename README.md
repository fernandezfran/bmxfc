## Content

The `datasets` folder contains the experimental data and the simulation of the 
map, and the `predictions` folder contains the predictions obtained with the 
`pipeline`.

## Disclaimer

This repository only have the predictions for a kinetic rate constant of 1e-7,
the other values reported in the paper can be obtained by slightly modifying
the `pipeline`.
